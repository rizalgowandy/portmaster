    Control your privacy even when connecting to new networks.

    In the Portmaster you configure settings to be active in one environment but not in the other, like allowing sensitive connections at home but not at the public library.

    The only thing you have to do is to change the network rating whenever you connect to a different network.
  nextKey: pilot-widget-NetworkRating-Trusted

    <span class="block verdict"></span><span class="block verdict outdated"></span> <b>Blocked</b> <br />
    <span class="verdict failed"></span><span class="verdict failed outdated"></span> <b>Failed</b> <br />

    If the circle is full, your _current_ settings allowed or blocked the connection.<br />
    If the circle is empty, _previous_ settings allowed or blocked the connection.
    Your current settings could decide differently.
